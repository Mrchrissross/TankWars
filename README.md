# TankWars

Tanks Wars is a project created for public use.

This package is perfect for those who want to make a 2D tank game that is either single player or multiplayer. 

It includes the following items: 

8 different player colours (Hulls + Cannons), 
2 additional jeeps, 
1 Mine, 
4 Rocks, 
1 Scrap item to used as a pickup, 
1 destroyed tank, 
1 Bullet. 

The package also comes with 3 scripts including a fully functioning player script allowing you to instantly change the colour of the tank. 
A bullet script and a fully functioning audio manager script. 
All scripts have been coded in a way that is easy to understand with room to add your own elements. 

Enjoy!

Before this asset pack was created, this game was used in my first ever assignment however all the code since then has been revamped and upgraded as my knowledge of programming increased. The game can be seen below or downloaded from the first commit:
