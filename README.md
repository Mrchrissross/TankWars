Unity 2020.3.2f1 | [Demo](https://mrchrissross.github.io/Tank-Wars-WebGL/) | [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/xKNka2dr0Ok) | [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/2d-tank-builder-178991)

Tank Builder offers you a quick and efficient way of building your own 2D top-down tank. It comes with a reliable controller that is easy to use as well as a smooth camera system that can be changed effectively. Each component comes with its own custom inspector that has tooltips on every visible field. The code has been fully commented on and is game-ready.

This asset also comes with many additional features and handmade art including all Photoshop PSDs and as I am still very new to this industry, any reviews, comments, and etc, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Before this asset pack was created, this game was used in my first ever assignment however all the code since then has been revamped and upgraded as my knowledge of programming increased. The game can be downloaded from the first commit or seen below:
